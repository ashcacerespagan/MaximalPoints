# MaximalPoints

This project visualizes maximal points in a 2D planeâ€”a great blend of geometric reasoning and JavaFX UI. The program compares each point to others and identifies those not dominated in both axes. It allowed me to work through spatial comparison logic and deliver intuitive visual output to reinforce abstract ideas.
